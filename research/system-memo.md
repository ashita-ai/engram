# Engram: Memory That Actually Works

**January 2025**

## The Problem Everyone Ignores

Ask ChatGPT what you told it last week. It has no idea.

Current AI memory solutions try to fix this by extracting "facts" from your conversations and storing them. Sounds reasonable. But here's the dirty secret: they throw away your actual words and keep only what the AI *thinks* you meant. When the AI misunderstands (and it will), there's no way back.

Recent benchmarks show these systems get it wrong **more than half the time**. That's not memory. That's a coin flip.

## What We Do Differently

Engram never throws away what you actually said.

Think of it like your own memory. You remember the conversation with your friend (the episode), but you also remember the takeaway (the meaning). If someone questions your takeaway, you can go back to what was actually said. That's what we do.

```
What you said  →  Stored forever, untouched
       ↓
What it means  →  Extracted, but always traceable back
```

## How Memories Get Smarter

Here's where it gets interesting. We didn't just build storage—we built something that learns.

**Memories that matter stick around.** Every time a memory gets used—retrieved, linked to something new, confirmed by new information—it gets stronger. Just like how you remember things better when you actually use them. (This is real science: the Testing Effect is one of the most robust findings in memory research.)

**Related memories find each other.** When you tell us you "prefer Python for scripts," that automatically links to the memory about you "using Python at work." You don't have to organize anything. The system figures out what goes together.

**Irrelevant stuff fades away.** That random detail from six months ago that never came up again? It slowly fades, just like real memory. This isn't a bug—it's how memory is supposed to work. It keeps the important stuff front and center.

**Retrieval has consequences.** When you search for something and get results back, the memories that *almost* matched but didn't make the cut get slightly weaker. This naturally prunes redundant or outdated information. (Psychologists call this Retrieval-Induced Forgetting, and yes, your brain does this too.)

## The Result

Put it all together and you get a memory system where:

- **Frequently-used facts** rise to the top automatically
- **Stale information** fades without you doing anything
- **Wrong extractions** can be traced back and fixed
- **Related knowledge** connects itself

You don't manage it. It manages itself.

## Why This Matters

Every AI agent needs memory to be useful. But memory that hallucinates is worse than no memory at all—it confidently tells you wrong things.

We built Engram because we were tired of AI memory that:
- Forgets what you literally just told it
- Confidently states things you never said
- Treats a wild guess the same as a direct quote
- Grows forever until it's useless

Memory should work like memory. It should remember what matters, forget what doesn't, and always let you check the receipts.

That's Engram.
